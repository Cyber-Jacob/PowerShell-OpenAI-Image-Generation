## OpenAI Image Generation 

This is a powershell script that can be used to generate OpenAI images in an ad-hoc way.
This script and any subsequent modules are based off the OpenAI documentation available at `https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images`

This script is a candidate to turn into a module. This will likely take the form of a Powershell-appropriate name such as "Invoke-OpenAI-Image-Request" or some other cmdlet type name.
